# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vitalii Shekhovtsov, and I'm on a journey to become a junior Java developer. Here on my GitHub profile, you'll find my projects and contributions as I learn and grow in the world of Java development.

## About Me

Since my first encounter with a computer, I've always been fascinated by understanding how it works, its functioning, software, and hardware. Later on, I got into learning various programming languages. It started as a hobby, and I never thought of pursuing it professionally. However, due to the war in my country, I was forced to move and change everything in my life, including my profession. Since February 2024, I've been attending a Java course at the Digital Career Institute and since then, I've been captivated by the versatility and power of Java.

## Projects

Here's where my projects will be ^_^

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the Java projects I've been working on.

## Learning Journey

I'm currently learning Java through various resources, including online courses, books, and hands-on projects. Here are some of the topics I'm focusing on:

- Object-oriented programming in Java
- Java core concepts (variables, data types, control flow, etc.)
- Working with Java frameworks like Spring Boot
- Database management with JDBC and Hibernate

## Future Goals

My ultimate goal is to land a role as a junior Java developer. To achieve this, I'm committed to honing my skills, gaining practical experience, and contributing to the Java community.
